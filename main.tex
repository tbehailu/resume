\jobentry{Software Engineering Intern}{Groupon, Palo Alto, CA}{June 2014 - August 2014}{Automated the collection of page performance metrics for the SEO team. Wrote clients for various external APIâ€™s, such as Dotcom-Monitor and Pingdom, to collect the performance statistics of SEO pages and integrated these into a rails application. Scheduled cron jobs regularly pull the page performance data to a MySQL database, and then add the data to Teradata. Application was deployed to production and is now accessible to all Groupon teams.}

\jobentry{Research Assistant/Marketing Director}{Institute for Law and Policy Planning, Berkeley, CA}{October 2011 - Present}{Shaped the marketing structure of ILPP to produce better results in both news searches and RFPs, ultimately leading to more jobs for the organization. }

% https://github.com/tbehailu/multi-agent-pacman.git

\projectnolink{Pacman Search \& Multi-Agent Pacman}{February 2014}{Built general search algorithms and applied them to pacman agent to find paths through a maze. Designed additional agents for game, implementing both minimax and expectimax search.}

% Processor Design
% \project{Processor Design}{November 2013}{https://github.com/tbehailu/Processor.git}{Used Logisim to create a 16-bit two-cycle processor. Designed the processor's register file to manage the four 16-bit registers in the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and the ALU to do a total of ten operations. Built the Data Memory using a built-in Logism RAM module. Wrote two MIPS functions for additional testing of the final CPU design.}
